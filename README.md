# Document API

How do we utilize ai on already existing documents?
How can this Document Service be used with AI?

## Technologies

- Python 3.11+
- Poetry
- Fast API
- PostgreSQL
- SQLAlchemy
- Uvicorn

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into the repository directory.
2. Check out the Python version `python --version` if less than 3.11 use `pyenv` to install and swithc to 3.11+
3. Make sure [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) is installed.
4. Create a virtual environment: `python -n venv env`
5. Activate the virtual environment:

    **On Windows:**
    Run the following command: `env\Scripts\activate`

    **On Linux:**
    Run the following command: `source env/bin/activate`

6. Install dependences: `poetry install`
7. You can run the server in 3 `different ways. Choose the one you want.

   - **Option 1 (run with poetry):**

      Run the following command `poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload`

   - **Option 2 (run using existing scripts):**

      _On Windows_
      Run the following command `scripts\run.bat`

      _On Linux_
    Make sure to give the scripts executable permissions if running on a Unix-like system. You can do this by running `chmod +x scripts/run.sh` in the terminal. Then run the following command `scripts/run.sh`

   - **Option 3 (run with Docker):**

    Run: `docker-compose build`
    Then run the following command: `docker-compose up`

8. Updating migrations
    **Updating Migrations**
    Run the following:

    `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Added user and document table"`

    `alembic upgrade head`

9. Access swagger docs at: `http:127.0.0.1:8080/docs`

## Features

### Authentication

- User registration: Users should be able to register by providing their username, email, and password.
- User login: Registered users should be able to log in using their username and password to obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT).
- JWT-based authentication: All protected routes should require authentication using JWT. Users should include the JWT in the authorization header of their requests.

### Document Upload

- Document Model: Create a document model with the following attributes:
  - `title`: Title of the document (string).
  - `file_type`: Type of the document, selected from a predefined list (enum).
  - `file_url`: URL or path to the uploaded file (string).
  - `description`: Description of the document (string).

- Upload Endpoint: Create an API endpoint to upload a document with the following features:
  - Accepts the document details (title, file type, file URL, description) as input.
  - Validates the input data against the defined model.
  - Stores the document in a database or file storage system.
  - Returns a success message or appropriate error response.

### Protected Route

- Retrieve All Documents: Create a protected route that requires authentication to retrieve all uploaded documents.
- Retrieve a Specific Document: Create a protected route that requires authentication to retrieve a specific document by its ID.
- Update Document Details: Create a protected route that requires authentication to update the details of a specific document.
- Delete Document: Create a protected route that requires authentication to delete a specific document.

### Additional Requirements

- Error Handling: Implement appropriate error handling and return meaningful error responses for various scenarios (e.g., invalid input, authentication failure, resource not found).
- Documentation: Generate API documentation automatically based on the defined routes and models.
- Unit Testing: Write unit tests to verify the functionality of the authentication, document upload, and text extraction endpoints.
- Security Considerations: Implement necessary security measures, such as password hashing for user authentication and secure file storage for uploaded documents.
- Extract Text from Images: Create an API endpoint to extract text from uploaded images. This endpoint should:
  - Accept an image file as input.
  - Process the image and extract text from it using OCR or other image processing techniques.
  - Return the extracted text as a response.
- CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated building, testing, and deployment of the application. Configure tasks for building the application, running tests, generating documentation, and deploying to a server or cloud platform.
- Deployment: Prepare the application for deployment to a server or cloud platform, including any necessary configuration files and instructions.
