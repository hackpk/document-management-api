The `functools` module provides various utility functions, and `lru_cache` is one of them.
We are importing `lru_cache` from `functools` to enable caching for the `get_settings` function.
Caching improves performance by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning them directly from cache when the same inputs occur again.
